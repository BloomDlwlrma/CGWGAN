**Crystal Generative Framework based on Wyckoff Generative Adversarial Network**

In this study, we present the Crystal Generative framework based on the Wyckoff Generative Adversarial Network (CGWGAN). CGWGAN employs a strategy focused on the generation of crystal templates, effectively masking the occupancy information of elements at specific sites within the crystal.

This repository provides the essential code for atom infill and phonon spectrum calculations, which are crucial for supporting CGWGAN.

All templates with 3-4 asymmetric units generated in our work are available as open-source resources on the [Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/caobin/CGWGAN).
